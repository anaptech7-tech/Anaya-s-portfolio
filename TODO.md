# Portfolio Revamp TODO List - Make More Creative and Vibrant Techy

## Global Updates
- [ ] Add AOS.js library to all HTML files
- [ ] Update CSS with vibrant color palette, gradients, shadows, transitions
- [ ] Add custom section dividers (wave patterns)
- [ ] Implement micro-interactions (hover glows, text reveals, button animations)
- [ ] Add back-to-top floating button
- [ ] Update JS for AOS initialization, typing animation, enhanced interactions

## Page-Specific Updates

- [x] Projects (projects.html): Larger cards with hover effects, ribbons, overlay for details, highlight Pleasant Tours
- [ ] Services (services.html): Colored cards with hover animations, icons
- [ ] Contact (contact.html): Gradient background, animated social icons, motivational line, form icons
- [x] Testimonials (testimonials.html): Vibrant styling

## New Vibrant Techy Enhancements

- [x] Add logo ("ChatGPT Image Nov 1, 2025, 01_36_50 PM.png") to navbar on all HTML pages (index.html, about.html, projects.html, services.html, testimonials.html, contact.html)
- [ ] Enhance css/style.css: Add brighter gradients (neon purples, cyans), glowing effects on buttons/images, subtle particle/circuit backgrounds, increased animation intensity (pulsing borders, hover transforms)
- [ ] Update js/script.js: Add particle background effect, enhance typing animation, add scroll-triggered glows/parallax for dynamic feel
